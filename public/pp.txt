•	Contact List Information: If you choose to use the contact matching feature, with your explicit consent and authorization, we may access your device's contact list to help you find contacts who are already using MPChat.

4. How We Store and Protect Your Personal Information
4.1 Information Storage
•	Storage Location: To provide you with global services, your personal information collected and generated by us may, based on our global operational needs, be stored on servers located in different jurisdictions. These locations may include, but are not limited to, our primary operating locations or the server locations of cloud service providers we use. Regardless of where your information is stored, we will take appropriate measures to protect your personal information in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
•	Cross-border Transfer: To support our global operations, your personal information may be processed in or transferred to other jurisdictions outside the country/region where you initially provided the information. In such cases, we will strictly comply with applicable data protection laws and regulations, taking measures including but not limited to necessary contractual safeguards, technical security, and organizational management measures to ensure that your personal information receives adequate protection at any processing or receiving location.
•	Storage Period: We will only retain your personal information for the period necessary to achieve the purposes described in this Policy, unless there is a mandatory retention requirement by applicable law. For example, laws in certain jurisdictions may require specific types of transaction information to be retained for several years from the date of transaction completion. We determine the storage period of personal information mainly by reference to the following standards and whichever is longer:
￮	Completing the transaction purposes related to you, maintaining corresponding transaction and business records, and responding to your possible inquiries or complaints;
￮	Ensuring the security and quality of the services we provide to you;
￮	Whether you agree to a longer retention period;
￮	Whether there are other special agreements or applicable legal requirements on the retention period. After your personal information exceeds the retention period, we will delete your personal information or anonymize it in accordance with the requirements of applicable laws.
4.2 Information Protection
•	We have implemented industry-standard, reasonably practicable security measures to protect the personal information you provide, preventing unauthorized access, public disclosure, use, modification, damage, or loss of personal information. For example, we use encryption technologies (such as SSL/TLS) to enhance the security of personal information; we use trusted protection mechanisms to prevent personal information from malicious attacks; we deploy access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized personnel can access personal information; and we conduct security and privacy protection training courses to strengthen employees' awareness of the importance of protecting personal information.
•	We will take reasonably practicable measures to avoid collecting irrelevant personal information. We will only retain your personal information for the period necessary to achieve the purposes described in this Policy, unless an extension of the retention period is required or permitted by law.
•	The internet is not an absolutely secure environment. We strongly recommend that you use secure methods and complex passwords to help us ensure the security of your account. If you discover that your personal information has been leaked, especially your account or password, please contact us immediately using the contact information provided at the end of this Policy so that we can take appropriate measures.
•	In the unfortunate event of a personal information security incident, we will, in accordance with the requirements of laws and regulations, promptly inform you of: the basic situation and possible impact of the security incident, the disposal measures we have taken or will take, suggestions for you to independently prevent and reduce risks, and remedial measures for you. We will inform you of the incident-related situation by email, letter, telephone, push notification, etc. When it is difficult to inform personal information subjects one by one, we will adopt a reasonable and effective way to issue an announcement. At the same time, we will also report the disposal of personal information security incidents in accordance with the requirements of regulatory authorities.

When you delete information from our services, we may not immediately delete the corresponding information from backup systems but will delete it when the backup is updated.
•	5.4 Change the Scope of Your Authorized Consent: Each business function requires some basic personal information to be completed. For the collection and use of additionally collected personal information, you can give or withdraw your authorized consent at any time. You can do this through the settings function within the MPChat application. When you withdraw your consent, we will no longer process the corresponding personal information. However, your decision to withdraw consent will not affect the personal information processing previously carried out based on your authorization.
•	5.5 Personal Information Subject Cancels Account: You can cancel your previously registered account at any time. You can do this yourself through paths such as "Settings" -> "Account and Security" -> "Cancel Account" within the MPChat application, or by contacting us through the contact information provided in this Policy.

•	5.7 Restrict Automated Decision-Making by Information Systems: In some business functions, we may make decisions based solely on non-manual automated decision-making mechanisms, including information systems, algorithms, etc. If these decisions significantly affect your legitimate rights and interests, you have the right to request an explanation from us, and we will also provide appeal methods without infringing on MPChat's trade secrets or the rights and interests of other users or the public interest.
•	5.8 Responding to Your Above Requests: To ensure security, you may need to provide a written request or otherwise prove your identity. We may ask you to verify your identity before processing your request. We will respond within fifteen (15) working days. If you are not satisfied, you can also file a complaint by contacting us. For your reasonable requests, we generally do not charge a fee, but for repeated requests that exceed reasonable limits, we will charge a certain cost fee as appropriate. We may refuse requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require excessive technical means (e.g., requiring the development of new systems or fundamentally changing existing practices), pose risks to the legitimate rights and interests of others, or are very impractical. In the following circumstances, as required by laws and regulations, we will not be able to respond to your request:
￮	Related to national security and defense security;
￮	Related to public safety, public health, and major public interests;

6. How We Handle Children's Personal Information
Our products, websites, and services are primarily aimed at adults. Children (as defined by applicable law in the respective region, for example, minors under the age of 13, 14, or 16 in certain jurisdictions) may not create their own user accounts without the consent of a parent or guardian.
For the collection of children's personal information with parental consent, we will only use or publicly disclose this information if permitted by law, with the explicit consent of parents or guardians, or as necessary to protect the child.
Although local laws and customs define children differently, we will consider anyone under the age of 14 as a child.
If we discover that we have collected children's personal information without prior verifiable parental consent, we will try to delete the relevant data as soon as possible.

7. How Your Personal Information Is Transferred Globally
In principle, the personal information we collect and generate within your jurisdiction will be stored within that jurisdiction.
As we provide products or services through globally distributed resources and servers, this means that, with your authorized consent, your personal information may be transferred to, or accessed from, jurisdictions outside the country/region where you use the product or service. Such jurisdictions may have different data protection laws or may not even have relevant laws. In such cases, for example, we will request your consent for cross-border transfer of personal information, or implement security measures such as data de-identification before cross-border data transfer, and enter into legally binding data transfer agreements with the data recipients.

8. How This Policy Is Updated
Our Privacy Policy may change.
We will not limit your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. We will post any changes to this Policy within the MPChat application or on our official website.
For material changes, we will also provide a more prominent notice (for example, for some services, we will send an email notification explaining the specific changes to the Privacy Policy, or provide an in-app push notification).
Material changes referred to in this Policy include, but are not limited to:
•	Significant changes in our service model, such as the purpose of processing personal information, the type of personal information processed, the way personal information is used, etc.;
•	Significant changes in our control, etc., such as changes in ownership caused by mergers and acquisitions, reorganizations, etc.;
