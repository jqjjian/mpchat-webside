Five Innovative B2B Uses of Virtual Cards in 2025

Everyone knows about virtual debit and credit cards. They’re everywhere — on our phones, our watches, even our rings. And they aren’t slowing down, either. Juniper Research is projecting virtual card transactions to surpass $175 billion by 2028.
While widely used by consumers, businesses are also adopting them for expenses, one-off payments, and departmental spend. But the full B2B potential of virtual cards extends far beyond this.
Here are five innovative B2B use cases we're watching — and delivering for our customers and partners — in 2025 and beyond:
1. Travel Intermediaries: New Products and Services
Online travel agencies are using virtual cards for global supplier payments and to create new revenue streams with value-add products at checkout.
Travel intermediaries have been using virtual cards to streamline global hotel and airline payments for decades. Now, they’re expanding their use to offer extra products and services directly within the payment process, boosting revenue and improving the booking experience.
With fierce competition and little price disparity, this is a great way for travel companies to differentiate themselves. For instance, holidaymakers can pay a fee to "lock in" a price, which is either applied to the booking later or retained if the booking is canceled. This model requires online travel agencies and aggregators to present a single checkout price that includes all services while handling supplier payments worldwide. It’s an entirely in-house revenue stream integrated into the payment flow and it’s powered by virtual cards.
2. Insurance Providers: Introducing Instant Claims
Insurance companies are leveraging virtual cards for instant settlement payouts to healthcare providers.
AXA Global Healthcare recently launched their virtual payment card, enabling members to pay for eligible outpatient treatment without using their funds, needing to submit a claim, or contacting their insurer to pre-authorize their treatment before they pay it. 
A virtual card is generated on the insurance app in the policy holder’s Apple Pay or Google Pay wallet that can be used anywhere that accepts contactless Visa payments. Companies like Paysure are integrated into the payment flow and check the claim history and eligibility in real-time. The MPChat issued virtual card then facilitates a direct and instant payment from the insurer to the medical provider, eliminating receipt fraud and avoiding lengthy reimbursement processes for the customer.
3. Freight and Logistics: Digitizing Port Payments
Global logistics and freight companies are using virtual cards to digitize shipping payments.
By their very nature, global logistics, freight, and shipping companies must make regular payments to multiple partners and vendors around the world. But this has traditionally involved paper-based invoicing and manual reconciliation.
Virtual cards are enabling these businesses to go digital. For example, in partnership with DP World, Mastercard is currently introducing virtual cards to eliminate physical invoicing from global shipping payments. This enables instant payments and automated reconciliation for all freight, port, and logistics costs. The platform will expand across Latin America and eventually to DP World's ports worldwide, supporting a global revenue of over $18 billion in virtual payments.
4. Digital Marketing: Greater Control on Ad Spending
E-commerce businesses and marketing departments are leveraging virtual cards to boost control and transparency of advertising spend.
As global e-commerce continues to rise, businesses selling goods online are increasingly turning to digital advertising as a way to target their buyers and generate cut-through. In 2023, Meta’s US advertising revenue reached almost $132 billion, with millions of businesses running ads on Facebook and Instagram every month. 
Virtual cards are increasingly playing a role here, with innovative fintechs like Franklin realising their potential to solve business’ marketing needs. For example, Franklin can link a MPChat-issued virtual card to a specific ad campaign or client on behalf of their customers. The ability to set high and flexible spend limits and expiration dates on each virtual card helps businesses to increase control and oversight over marketing spend.
5. Workplace Benefits: Replacing Coupons with Cards
Employers are using virtual cards to digitize employee meal vouchers, a popular benefit in continental Europe. 
Employee expenses have long been a key use case for virtual cards, but meal vouchers, a popular benefit in continental Europe, have remained largely analogue. In France, 57% of employers currently give their employees a voucher for every day worked in a month, and often in the form of a physical coupon. In 2024, these meal vouchers had a total value of close to €8.5 billion.
However, four voucher issuers control 99% of the market, and the French Competition Authority (ADLC) has called for tighter regulation and mandatory digitization. In 2024, 40% of vouchers were still issued as physical coupons. In countries like Italy and Portugal, high processing fees – ranging from 5-20% – make these schemes costly for retailers. Employee issued single-use virtual cards, controlled by merchant category codes, could solve this problem and significantly modernize this $25-$30 billion market opportunity across Europe.
The First-Mover Advantage
Virtual cards are already impacting multiple industries, but there’s still so much more to come. The space remains an open playing field, with the companies that recognize the full B2B potential of virtual cards still able to create a competitive edge, boost efficiency, and drive growth.
Best Credit Card Processing Solutions for Small Businesses in 2025: Recommendations
Selecting the right credit card payment processing service is critical to the success of any small business. To meet customer demands and streamline operations, small businesses need secure and cost-effective payment solutions. Against a backdrop of rising processing fees and rapidly evolving technology, finding the right payment provider directly impacts a company's profitability.
This article will explore the key factors in choosing a credit card payment processing service for small businesses, examine industry trends for 2025, and highlight innovative payment solutions that can empower small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
Why Small Businesses Need the Best Credit Card Processing Service

Small businesses rely on flexible and efficient operations, and an excellent credit card processing system is a key tool to achieve this goal. A stable and reliable payment provider not only ensures smooth transactions but also reduces costs and enhances customer trust. Key advantages include:
- Customer Convenience: Offering multiple payment options, including credit and debit cards, improves customer satisfaction and increases sales conversions.
- Cost Control: High processing fees can erode profits. An optimal payment processing solution should feature transparent and competitive rates.
- Data Security: With rising cybersecurity risks, PCI DSS compliance and advanced anti-fraud technology have become non-negotiable.
- Scalability: As a business grows, the ability to support multi-currency and cross-border transactions becomes especially important.
Choosing the right credit card payment service not only optimizes operational efficiency but also improves cash flow and supports market expansion.
Key Features to Look for in a Credit Card Processing Service

When searching for the ideal credit card payment processing service for your small business, focus on these core features:
Transparent and Reasonable Pricing Payment processing fees can be complex, including transaction fees, monthly fees, and setup fees. Choose a provider that offers flat-rate or low per-transaction pricing to avoid hidden costs. If your transaction volume is high, you may be able to negotiate lower rates with the provider.
Global Payment Support Small businesses targeting international markets should prioritize providers that support multi-currency settlements and cross-border payments. This helps avoid losses from exchange rate fluctuations and expands your global customer base.
Security and Compliance Guarantees Payment security must be a top priority. Select a payment service provider that is PCI DSS Level 1 certified and supports 3D Secure 2.0 verification to protect customer information and reduce fraud risk. Real-time transaction monitoring can also help detect suspicious activity promptly.
System Integration and Ease of Use The best credit card processing services should integrate seamlessly with your existing systems, such as e-commerce platforms, accounting software, or POS systems. The admin dashboard should be user-friendly, and real-time reporting features can help you manage expenses and reconcile accounts.
Flexible Card Issuing Services Some payment services offer card-issuing capabilities, allowing businesses to issue virtual or physical cards for employees or customers as needed. This feature is particularly beneficial for cross-border operations, helping to optimize financial management and payment flexibility.

Credit Card Payment Processing Industry Trends in 2025

The payment industry is evolving rapidly, driven by technological advancements and consumer expectations. Small businesses should pay attention to the following trends:
- The Rise of Contactless Payments: Mobile wallets and tap-to-pay are becoming increasingly popular. Service providers must support NFC technology to meet user preferences.
- AI-Powered Fraud Prevention: Using artificial intelligence to detect fraudulent activities, reduce chargebacks, and enhance payment security is now a standard feature of top-tier payment services.
- Embedded Finance Solutions: Integrating payment functions directly into a business's native systems significantly improves operational efficiency and user experience.
- Global Market Expansion: As more small businesses go international, the demand for payment solutions that support low-cost cross-border transactions is surging.
Keeping up with these trends will help businesses remain agile and achieve sustainable growth in a competitive market.
How to Choose the Best Credit Card Processing Service for Your Business

To select the right credit card processing solution for your company, follow these evaluation steps:
1. Assess Your Business Needs: Determine your transaction volume, average ticket size, and whether you need to support online, in-person, or international payments.
2. Compare Pricing Models: Opt for a plan with transparent pricing and no hidden fees. Businesses with low transaction volumes may prefer a flat-rate model, while those with high frequency are better suited to a cost-plus model.
3. Check Integration Capabilities: Confirm that the payment service can connect with your e-commerce platform, POS system, or accounting software.
4. Evaluate Security Measures: Prioritize providers with PCI DSS certification and robust anti-fraud systems.
5. Consider Scalability: Choose a provider that supports advanced features like international payments and card issuing to accommodate future business growth.
By focusing on these factors, businesses can find a payment solution that truly fits their operational model.
